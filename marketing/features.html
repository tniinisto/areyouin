                <a href="#" class="image fit"><img style="width: 60%; height: 60%;   display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/responsive.png" alt="" /></a>

                <p style="width: 60%; text-align: center; display: inline-block;"> There are two types of web clients available.
                    Both are responsive and work on all devices. The full client has more features like the event management in it.
                    The other client is designed for mobile usage and has only the the events and chat features. When opening the app on
                    mobile a question is presented on which one to use, user can decide of course. Whit most smartphones the direct 
                    link can be placed on devices home screen on most devices, where it is easily available and looks like a native 
                    application icon. User can also set direct link to the mobile app and with this the login is directly available. 
                    </p>

                <p style="width: 60%; text-align: center; display: inline-block;"><strong>Events</strong> 
                    have location, start & end times and participants with it. Summary on the event participation is shown at 
                    the top of each event, where you can see how many is going to participate and how many have been invited for 
                    the event. Clicking the summary maximises the event view and each participant's status is shown separately. 
                    User's own IN/OUT status is always visible and directly accessible on the event. 
                    Clicking the event's location opens Google Maps in a new tab on browser showing the event's location. 
                    Each user's "avatar" is rounded with a yellow border in the event indicating that the user has seen the event. 
                    Web notifications are also available same as with chat, notifications are given on event changes.</p>

                <p style="width: 60%; text-align: center; display: inline-block;"><strong>Chat</strong> is a basic character based 
                    messaging board. It shows all messages within the group. On new messages an indication is shown on the app's 
                    navigation menu. On PC & tablet browsers also a notification with sound is given if the user is logged in and even 
                    if the browser is minimized. Nowadays Chrome & Firefox support web notifications which gives a notification 
                    message on the operating system. IE, Edge & Safari browsers give only a sound when a notifications occurs. 
                    Unfortunately smartphone browsers doen't yet support native web notifications, but when they start the 
                    notifications are already in the app :)</p>

                <p style="width: 60%; text-align: center; display: inline-block;"><strong>Profile</strong> shows user's basic 
                    information like nickname, first & last names, email (this is also the userID used in the app login), phone and 
                    wether mail notifications are wanted from new events. There are also the password change and own "avatar" upload 
                    features.</p>

                <p style="width: 60%; text-align: center; display: inline-block;"><strong>Admin</strong> user has the ability to set 
                    and update events, add new users to the group and manage locations. On locations can also be decided if weather 
                    info is wanted to be displayed on the events page for the location.
