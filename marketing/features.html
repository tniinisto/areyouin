                <a href="#" class="image fit"><img style="width: 60%; height: 60%;   display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/responsive.png" alt="" /></a>

                <p style="width: 60%; text-align: center; display: inline-block;"> There are two types of web clients available.
                    Both are responsive and work on all devices. The full client has more features like the event management in it.
                    The other client is designed for mobile usage and has only the the events and chat features. When opening the app on
                    a mobile device a question is presented on which one to use, user can decide of course. With most smartphones a direct 
                    link can be placed on device's home screen where it is easily available and looks like a native 
                    application icon. User can also set direct link to the mobile app client if he/she prefers and with this the mobile app login is directly available. 
                    </p>

                <p style="width: 60%; text-align: center; display: inline-block;"><strong>Events</strong> 
                    have location, start & end times and participants with it. Summary on the event participation is shown at 
                    the top of each event, where you can see how many is going to participate and how many have been invited for 
                    the event. Clicking the summary maximises the event view and each participant's status is shown separately. 
                    User's own IN/OUT status is always visible and directly accessible on the event. 
                    Clicking the event's location opens Google Maps in a new tab on browser showing the event's location. 
                    Each user's "avatar" is rounded with a yellow border in the event indicating that the user has seen the event. 
                    Web notifications are available on PC & tablet browsers, notifications are given on event changes.</p>

                <p style="width: 60%; text-align: center; display: inline-block;"><strong>Chat</strong> is a basic character based 
                    messaging board. It shows all messages within the group. On new messages an indication is shown on the app's 
                    navigation menu. On PC & tablet browsers also a notification with sound is given if the user is logged in 
                    and even if the browser is minimized on the operating system. Nowadays Chrome & Firefox support web notifications 
                    which give a popup note on the display. IE, Edge & Safari browsers give only a sound when a notification occurs. 
                    Unfortunately smartphone browsers doen't yet support native web notifications, but when they start the 
                    notifications are already in the app :)</p>

                <p style="width: 60%; text-align: center; display: inline-block;"><strong>Profile</strong> shows user's basic 
                    information like nickname, full name, email (this is also the userID used in the login), phone and 
                    wether mail notifications are wanted from new events or not. There is also the password change and 
                    own "avatar" upload available for the user. Statistics on events and user's participation can be seen on a graph.</p>

                <p style="width: 60%; text-align: center; display: inline-block;"><strong>Admin</strong> user has the ability to set 
                    and update events, add new users to the group and manage event locations. On locations can also be decided if weather 
                    info is wanted to be displayed on the events page for the location. 
                    He/She can also set other users as admins. </p>
